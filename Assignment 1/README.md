  <h1>Reflection</h1>

  <p>The only piece of feedback that I got was to make the colors pop more, so the first thing that I did was change them to be on theme with the game more. Now I think it pops more, but it is also a little busier.While doing this, I made the tex white so it shows well on the dark purple backgroud</p>
  <p>The other change I made was based on other reviews where I chose to edit the background so its staggered on each heading. This makes a big difference, but I think it adds a lot to to the website and changes the look.</p>
